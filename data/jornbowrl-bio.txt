Wang Jian is a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, supported by an AISingapore scholarship. His team is now heavily involved in pushing the boundary of robust vision and robust AI by creating high-realism adversarial attacks such as trace-based repair Neural networks, adversarial motion blur, facial-skew adversarial detection, etc.

He obtained a bachelor's degree from Tianjin University in 2011, and an AI-CV certificate from Tsinghua University in 2019. In 2020, he began a doctorate at Nanyang Technological University. During this year, he published papers in IJCAI 2020, NIPS 2020, and ICML 2021 as a co-author. Hosted several academic conferences ICFEM 2020, APSEC 2020, ICECCS 2020, and InternetWare 2020.

He has several years of experience in some frontier Internet firms in development and management. From 2017 to 2019, he worked as a research scientist at Xiaomi AILab, responsible for building the Xiaomi AI deep learning framework and visual algorithm service module. From 2011 to 2017, he participated in and built a company-level user profile and behavior analysis system on 58.com; he once led the company-level high-performance asynchronous WEB framework. This framework still carries the companyâ€™s 100 million-level traffic visits (daily average) to this day.
